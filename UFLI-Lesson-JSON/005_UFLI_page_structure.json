When I tell you what letter you need, look for it on your tray.  Once you find it, pick it up and put it at the bottom of your tray close to you.\rRemember, our letters are in alphabetical order. It is important that our letters stay on our tray. When using our trays, we need to move one letter at a time.\rMy turn, watch me first. I need to find the letter A.  Once I find the letter A I pick it up and put it at the bottom of my tray.\r(Model finding the letter A on tray and moving it to the bottom.)\rYour turn. Point to the letter A on your tray.\r(Check that students are pointing to letter A.)\rNow pick up the letter A and put it at the bottom of your tray.\rSometimes we will need to switch letters. Let's try that. Everyone put your letter A back in its place. Now you should not have any letters at the bottom of your tray. Our new letter is S. Find the letter S on your tray, pick it up, and put it at the bottom of your tray.\r(Repeat as needed, having students practice finding letters and putting them back.)\rWe will do word work during our lessons to make us strong readers and spellers.
